# HEADLESS CMS

Current Status:

- Created a WYSIWYG with some hard coded CSS 
- Content state is currently being saved as an object to the database



Next Steps: 

- Need to create event handler buttons for text editing purposes for the WYSIWYG
- Fix current state so that content is taken in properly
